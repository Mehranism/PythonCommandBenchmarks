# PythonCommandBenchmarks

PythonCommandBenchmarks is a project aimed at comparing the performance and execution speed of various commands within a specific domain. The results of these benchmarks are presented in both numerical and visual formats.

## Execution time of list_directories commands

In the "Execution time of list_directories commands" directory, we have conducted an analysis of commonly used commands for retrieving a list of directories within a directory. The execution time of each command has been evaluated under different conditions. The following five commands were examined:

- `os_scandir()`
- `os_walk()`
- `glob.glob()`
- `pathlib_iterdir()`
- `os_listdir()`

## Methodology

The benchmarking process involved running standardized tests and workloads to measure the execution time of each command. The tests were conducted using the latest version of Python and under various scenarios to account for different conditions and factors that may impact performance.

## Results

The results of the benchmarking process can be found in the respective directories for each command. The data is presented in a clear and concise manner, allowing users to easily compare the execution times of different commands.

Please note that the performance of these commands may vary depending on factors such as hardware, software environment, and specific implementation details.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the benchmark coverage, improve accuracy, and include additional commands for evaluation. If you would like to contribute, please follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
